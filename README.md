SN-FileSync-UI
==============

If you just want to run this go to the folder dist. Under this double click on SNFileSyncUI.app and the utility will run. Upon opening you will need to add instances and tables in order to get everything running.

In the works
============
* Adding the ability to pull all files from an instance
* Any suggestions on how to limit this or better ways of syncing data are greatlly appreciated.
